# Hardware
Here's a list of hardware necessary to make the phone work:

 - 1 [Raspberry Pi](https://www.adafruit.com/products/2358)
 - 1 [Adafruit 2.8in PiTFT](https://www.adafruit.com/products/1601)
 - 1 [(Optional) Adafruit Powerboost 1000C](https://www.adafruit.com/products/2465)
 - 1 [(Optional) Adafruit Lipo Battery 2500mAh](https://www.adafruit.com/products/328)
 
This application works great with cobblr-phone(http://github.com/TheQYD/cobblr-phone). If you'd like to make a cellphone that uses Cobblr, you can follow the directions [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/piphone-a-raspberry-pi-based-cellphone/pi-setup?view=all) to wire it up.
# How to Install

Follow the directions to install the [Cobblr framework](http://github.com/TheQYD/cobblr). The PiTFT should be configured in portrait mode (no rotation). Once that's finished, and the framework is installed, execute this command:
```
sudo cobblr install cobblr-music
```

# More

Though not required, I've made a polycarbonate and aluminum body for it. The CADs are avaliable [here](https://github.com/TheQYD/CAD/tree/master/cobblr-phone). Other applications were made to work with the cobblr-music:

- [cobblr-phone](http://gihub.com/TheQYD/cobblr-phone)
- [cobblr-calculator](http://gihub.com/TheQYD/cobblr-calculator)
